Project: Create a quotation generator

Step 1: Random quotes

There are plenty of text generators online. Google "quote generator," and you will find many sites that randomly generate quotes by assembling sentence fragments.

Your turn to create one! You must respect the following criteria:

    The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each JavaScript call

    Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments (it's up to you to create these sentence fragments: beginning, middle, and end)

    The quotes should be relatively coherent (no exclamation points in the middle of a sentence, for example)

The program can simply display each result in the JavaScript console.

Files to provide:

    A JavaScript file of your code

Step 2: More customized quotes

You now want to go further and offer the following options:

    Select the number of quotes generated (between 1 and 5)

    Choose between 2 types of quote generators (accordingly, you'll need two different sets of sentences)

    Once the quotes are generated, have the program generate new quotes or quit the program

Adapt the program so that it has these features!
